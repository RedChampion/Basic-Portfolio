                    <p id="about">Hello! My name is Christian and I'm a student at the UW coding bootcamp.  I decided to take this class to advance my career in a field that I find fun.  One of my friends once told me that "coding is like playing with legos, you can build anything you want from scratch.", and that intrigued me so I started to look into it.  Long story short, I ended up in a full-time bootcamp dedicated to coding.  Outside of work I enjoy playing video games, playing D&D, and spending time with my friends.</p>
